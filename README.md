# stats220_demo

This is my demo repo for STATS 220. 

*I will use this for demonstrating various STATS 220 related teaching things.*

Are you one of my students?

- Feel free to follow me
- Feel free to watch this repository
- You can even ‚≠ê the repo if you want 

You can also check out my [UoA profile page](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/a-fergusson).

This README file is intentionally boring. It could probably do with some images, or more emoji üò∫

## Memes and stuff

Just a [link to some cat memes](https://icanhas.cheezburger.com/cat-meme-of-the-decade)!
